This is the recording of a talk I gave in March 2011 to the Xrm Virtual group (http://www.xrmvirtual.com/). Back then I was on the Microsoft Dynamics CRM team and very interested in game-ification. The talk revolves around a social game we built inside the Dynamics CRM team and how others might apply game-ification to their CRM/XRM installations.

Posting it here since it's expired off the Xrm Virtual server.
